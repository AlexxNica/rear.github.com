## Development ##

Currently the Rear project is migrating from using
[Sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/rear) for development to the Github
infrastructure at <http://github.com/rear>.

Github will be used for hosting the website, the source code and the
issue-tracker, but the mailinglist will remain at Sourceforge.


## Mailinglists

The Rear project offers two mailinglists:

 - [Users mailinglist](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/rear-users)
   used for support and development discussions
 - [Announce mailinglist](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/rear-announce)
   used for release announcements


## Reporting issues ##

The Github interface enables users to report issues or discuss improvements
and new features through the issue-tracker at:
<http://github.com/rear/source/issues>

Once reported, one of the contributors can assign it to himself, classify the
issue by tagging it or link it to a specific milestone release. Managing issues
in this manner helps in collaborating, but also provides full transparency to
users and contributors alike.


## Contributing ##

If you are interested in contributing to Rear, you can discuss your area
of interest on the Rear users mailinglist, or you can simply fork the project
on Github, make the modifications and then do a pull-request.

This makes it easy for the project to discuss the changes through the
pull-request, and when accepted to merge the pull-request in the project.
