## Development
The Relax-and-Recover project uses Github for [source code management](https://github.com/rear),
issue tracking and this website.

Rear is fully developed with the bash language and we follow the [coding styling described on the rear wiki page](https://github.com/rear/rear/wiki/Coding-Style)


### Mailinglists
The Relax-and-Recover project offers three mailinglists:

 - [rear-announce mailinglist](http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/mailman/listinfo/rear-announce)
   used for release announcements
 - [rear-users mailinglist](http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/mailman/listinfo/rear-users)
   used for end-user support
 - [rear-devel mailinglist](http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/mailman/listinfo/rear-devel)
   used for development discussions


### Reporting issues
The Github interface enables users to report issues or discuss improvements
and new features through the issue-tracker at:
<http://github.com/rear/rear/issues>

Once reported, one of the contributors can assign it to someone, classify it
and attached it to a milestone release. Managing issues in this manner helps
in collaborating, but also provides full transparency to users and contributors
alike.


### Release planning
New releases are planned based on outstanding issues, new features and ongoing
development. You can get an overview of the various milestones the project has
defined and you can influence new releases by reporting issues and by
contributing fixes at: <https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/milestones>


### Contributing
If you are interested in contributing to Relax-and-Recover, you can discuss
your area of interest on the users mailinglist, or you can simply fork the
project on Github, make the modifications and then do a pull-request.

This makes it easy for the project to discuss the changes through the
pull-request, and when accepted to merge the pull-request into the project.
