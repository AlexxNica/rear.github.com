## Development ##

Currently the Rear project is migration from using
[Sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/rear) for development to the Github
infrastructure at http://github.com/rear.

Github will be used for hosting the website, the source code and the
issue-tracker, but the mailinglist will remain at Sourceforge.


## Reporting issues ##

The Github interface enables users to report issues or discuss improvements
and new features through the issue-tracker at http://github.com/rear/issues


## Contributing ##

If you are interested in contributing to Rear, you can discuss your area
of interest on the Rear mailinglist, or you can fork the project on Github,
make the modifications and then do a pull-request.

This makes it easy for the project to discuss the changes through the
pull-request, and when accepted to merge the pull-request in the project.
