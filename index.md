# Rear website

Relax and Recover (Rear) is the leading Open Source disaster recovery
solution, and successor to mkcdrec. It comprises of a modular framework
and ready-to-go workflows for many common situations to produce a bootable
image and restore from backup using this image. As a benefit, it allows to
restore to different hardware and can therefore be used as a migration
tool as well.

Currently Rear supports various boot media (incl. ISO, PXE, OBDR tape,
USB or eSATA storage), a variety of network protocols (incl. sftp, ftp,
http, nfs, cifs) as well as a multitude of backup strategies (incl.
IBM TSM, HP DataProtector, Symantec NetBackup, Bacula, rsync).

Rear was designed to be easy to set up, requires no maintenance and is
there to assist when disaster strikes. Its setup-and-forget nature eradicates
any excuses for not having a disaster recovery solution implemented.

Recovering from disaster is made very straight-forward by a 2-step recovery
process so that it can be executed by operational teams when required.
When used interactively (e.g. when used for migrating systems), menus help
make decisions to restore to a new (hardware) environment.

Extending Rear is made possible by its modular framework. Consistent
logging and optionally extended output help understand the concepts behind
Rear and help debug during development.
