## Community support ##

For voluntary community support, you can use the issue-tracker or the
mailinglist. Please visit the [Development](/development/) page for
information on how to collaborate on the project and discuss issues.

We expect users to try the latest release, understand the basic concepts of
Rear and provide us with as much detail as possible regarding the experienced
problem(s) in order to quickly resolve user problems.

The details we require may include:

 - Rear version and distribution version information
 - custom configuration (found in _/etc/rear/_)
 - Rear log (found in _/tmp/rear*.log_)
   + Optionally run with debugging enabled
 - screen output

Rest assured, the Rear developers do not like bugs either and are very grateful
for reported issues and improvements, preferably with details.


## Commercial Support ##

you to support Rear development by making use of support contract or consulting
