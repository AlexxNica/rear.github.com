## Community support ##
For voluntary community support, you can use the
[issue-tracker](http://github.com/rear/source/issues) or the
[mailinglist](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/rear-users).
Please visit the [Development](/development/) page for information on
how to collaborate on the project and discuss issues.

We expect users to try the latest release, understand the basic concepts of
Rear and provide us with as much detail as possible regarding the experienced
problem(s) in order to quickly resolve user problems. The details we require
may include:

 - Rear version and distribution version information
 - custom configuration ( found in */etc/rear/* )
 - screen output
 - Rear log ( found in */tmp/rear\*.log* )
   * Optionally run with debugging enabled

Rest assured, the Rear developers do not like bugs either and are very grateful
for reported issues and improvements, preferably with details.


## Commercial Support ##
If your company depends on Rear as a disaster recovery solution, we kindly ask
you to support Rear development by making use of support contracts or consulting
services offered by one of the contributors to the project:

 - [IT3 Consultants](http://www.it3.be/) (Gratien D'haese)
 - [Dagit Linux Solutions](http://dagit.net/) (Dag WieÃ«rs)
 - [Schlomo Schapiro](mailto:rear-commercial@schlomo.schapiro.org)

The various contributors have invested a lot in the creation and support of Rear.
