## Community support
For voluntary community support, you can use the
[issue-tracker](http://github.com/rear/rear/issues) or the
[mailinglist](https://lists.relax-and-recover.org/lists/listinfo/rear-users).
Please visit the [Development](/development/) page for information on
how to collaborate on the project and discuss issues.

We expect users to try the latest release, understand the basic concepts of
Relax-and-Recover and provide us with as much detail as possible regarding
the experienced problem(s) in order to quickly resolve user problems.
The details we require may include:

 - Relax-and-Recover version and distribution version information
 - custom configuration ( found in */etc/rear/* )
 - screen output
 - Relax-and-Recover log ( found in */tmp/rear\*.log* )
   - Optionally run with debugging enabled

Rest assured, the Relax-and-Recover developers do not like bugs either
and are very grateful for reported issues and improvements, preferably
with details.
